It has been a long time since I attempted to write a blog post! Meanwhile I have been predominantly busy finishing my Master's at Arizona State University. As the sun sets down on the other side of the valley, I wanted to share the new things I learnt from here in a quick recap style blog. Here are the top three classes I took at ASU and what I learnt at from them.

### 3. Advanced Operating System with Dr. Adil Ahmad (Spring 2023 and Fall 2023)

#### How I found this course

Technically I did not take this class as in taking this class as a student, rather I was a grader for this class, without knowing what was going to be in this course. I took another class from the same professor as in CSE 598: Special Topics: Trusted Computing in Clouds, in fall 2022. That class was really good and I loved being in that class as a student. So, during the final project of the Fall 2022 class, I asked professor to be a grader in his next class, and he approved, and also his recommendation got me to get the grader position for that semseter. As a grader, I got to see the ins and outs of designing a course, designing the assignments, I myself also got to work on the assignments, before professor gave us the grading rubric. Overall this was to be honest an unique way of attending a class without the stress of submitting an assignment. 

#### What was unique about the course? 

Previously I had theoretically read about the different aspects of Operating Systems like bootloader, process loading, scheduling, multithreading, and many more. This is the first time I got to play with those concepts in an actual (playful) operating system called xv6. For those of you who don't know xv6, it is an amazing mini operating system developed by the researchers at MIT, and has a few different flavours. The one we got to play with is the riscv version of the operating system. 

For those of you who don't know what riscv is, it is an open architecture for CPUs, on which ARM is based off of. While you need to license ARM, you don't need any licensing for riscv, which makes making the software based on the low level code very easy. This is a bonus for any operating system developed as open source.
